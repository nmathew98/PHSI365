# Coursework for PHSI365 Computational Modelling

PHSI365 aims to provide the core tools and methdology of computational physics. The emphasis is on gaining practical skills and gaining the techniques and confidence to tackle a broad range of problems in Physics. This paper also serves as an introduction to programming in Julia and functional programming. I have uploaded all the coursework I could find though there are a few that are missing.

Topics explored include:

- Computational units and dimensional analysis
- Solving systems of coupled ordinary equations, linear and nonlinear systems
- Discretization, partial differential equations (heat/diffusion equation, Schr√∂dinger equation)
- Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and spectral analysis (analysis of climate and space weather data)
- Stochastic methods (analysis of climate and space weather data)
- Real-world applications and BIG DATA
