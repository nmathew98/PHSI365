    "    \n",
    "    Load the package and define the parameters. You can type `\\pm<tab>` to get the $\\pm$ symbol for entering uncertainties. \n",
    "1. Use the syntax [described on this page](https://juliaphysics.github.io/Measurements.jl/stable/examples/#Integration-with-Plots.jl-1) to plot $y(t)$ with uncertainties over time. Assume your clock recording the times associated with each observed height is only accurate to $\\pm 0.1\\textrm{s}$. Plot the height of the mass as a function of time, together with errorbars that show the estimated uncertainty according to linear error propagation theory. On the same plot, show a line of constant height $h$ for the value shown above including error. Limit your plot axes to the range $0<x<7$, $-20<y<60$ \\[e.g. `xlims!(0,5)` will modify the current plot\\]. Estimate the roots by zooming in on the points where the lines cross (You can just use `xlims!`, `ylims!` for this).\n",

You should be able to get quite accurate solutions by enlarging regions of the plot. Is this graphical approach giving results consistent with your previous plot of $y(t)$?\n",
    "1. To find solutions numerically you will need to use a **root finding** algorithm. Use the julia package [Roots](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Roots.jl) (you may need to install it) to find as many solutions for $t$ as roots of $F(t)$ as you can, for the chosen parameters. Do the errors reported by rootfinding agree with those of your exact solution? Is this what you expect?\n",

    "2. Your notebook should include a clear statement of the equations used, and a concise discussion that interprets your findings. Do your answers make sense? How did you check your results?"
