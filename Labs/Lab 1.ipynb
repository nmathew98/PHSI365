So the true timing we are interested in is for any call _after_ the first one where it is defined (redefinitions count as definitions too!).\n",

    "(c) Use only a single-line __vectorised__ `julia` expression to calculate $s$ (no function wrapper). If you haven't done this before, the strategy is to define a vector `n=[1 2 3 ... 10000]` (you can do this with a range object `1:10000`, even though it looks a bit different to a vector, it still behaves like one in most circumstances). Then perform local (dot) operations to achieve the result. You should be able to get this down to one very short expression that easily fits on one line. Time it.\n",

    "(d) Wrap your single-line expression in a function `mysum2()` and time this. \n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Use the package [BenchmarkTools](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl), and the macro `@btime` to compare more accurate timings for (b),(c),(d) (`@btime` averages over multiple calls, so the garbage collection is triggered. This is a more honest realistic time). What can you conclude about the speed of vectorizing (writing in terms of array operations), as compared with writing a `for` loop? Would you recommend vectorizing code in julia? Why? "
